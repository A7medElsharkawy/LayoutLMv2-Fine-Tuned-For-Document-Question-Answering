# LayoutLMv2-Fine-Tuned-For-Document-Question-Answering

## Description:
This project leverages LayoutLMv2, a state-of-the-art model for document understanding, fine-tuned specifically for Document Question Answering (DQA) tasks. LayoutLMv2 is designed to effectively combine text, layout, and image information from document data, enabling advanced understanding and contextualization of structured documents such as invoices, forms, contracts, and more.

Through fine-tuning, the model is optimized to accurately answer questions based on the document's content by utilizing its pre-trained capabilities to understand document layouts and relationships between visual and textual elements.
